v2.3 Changes 20160427

+ Removed requirement that longitude be [-180,180]. Does not seem to matter
  and was inconsistent with IDL [0,360]

+ Removed all .d refences to indicate double precision numeric values.
  Not compatible with some compilers, i.e., MSC and Mac(?).

+ #define M_PI if not already defined in aacgmlib_v2.h and igrflib.h

+ Added missing prototypes in igrflib.h

+ Added definition for NAN and protected definition of complex for MSC
  compatibility

+ Added environment variable IGRF_COEFFS instead of #define and assumption
  that file is in current directory.

+ Added MLT functionality:
           mlt = MLTConvertYMDHMS_v2()
           mlt = MLTConvertEpoch_v2()
           mlt = MLTConvertYrsec_v2()

  requires additional files: mlt_v2.c, astalg.c, and time.c

+ Made the radial output of AACGM-v2 conversions more meaningful. Previously r 
  was always set to 1.0. The following excerpt describes what this parameter is
  now set to. Note that the other outputs (lat,lon) remain unchanged.


;       All AACGM-v2 conversions are done in geocentric coordinates using a
;           value of 6371.2 km for the Earth radius.
;
;       For G2A conversion inputs are geographic latitude, longitude and
;           height (glat,glon,height), specified as either geocentric or
;           geodetic (default). For geodetic inputs a conversion to geocentric
;           coordinates is performed, which changes the values of
;           glat,glon,height. The output is AACGM-v2 latitude, longitude and
;           the geocentric radius (mlat,mlon,r) using the geocentric height
;           in units of RE.
;
;        For A2G conversion inputs are AACGM-v2 latitude, longitude and the
;            geocentric height (mlat,mlon,height). The latter can be obtained
;            from the r output of the G2A conversion. The output is geographic
;            latitude, longitude and height (glat,glon,height). If the
;            gedodetic option is desired (default) a conversion of the outputs
;            is performed, which changes the values of glat,glon,height.
